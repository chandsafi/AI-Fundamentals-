Python Basics Repository
Welcome to my Python Basics repository! This repository contains six key files that cover essential Python programming topics. Each file includes example codes to help you understand fundamental concepts, making it a valuable resource for beginners and those looking to refresh their Python skills.

Repository Structure
1. Python Basics
This file covers the fundamentals of Python, including:

Variables
Data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
Input/output
Basic operations (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
2. Python Loops
Learn about different types of loops in Python, including:

for loops
while loops
Loop control statements (break, continue, pass)
3. Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries
This file provides example codes for commonly used data structures in Python:

Tuples: Immutable sequences
Lists: Mutable sequences with various methods for manipulation
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs for fast lookups and data storage
4. Classes
Dive into object-oriented programming with Python classes. Topics covered include:

Class creation and initialization (__init__)
Instance variables and methods
Object instantiation and usage
5. Inheritance
Understand how to reuse code with Python's inheritance mechanism:

Single inheritance
Method overriding
Superclass and subclass relationships
6. Abstraction and Encapsulation
Learn about these essential principles of object-oriented programming:

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essentials
Encapsulation: Restricting direct access to some of an object's components
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine and explore the example codes in each file. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to gain a deeper understanding of Python.
